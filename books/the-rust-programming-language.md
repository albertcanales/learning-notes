Latest release available here: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/>.

# Getting Started

## Hello Cargo!

To sum up:

- `cargo new PROJECT` creates a new project
- `cargo check` builds without producing executables (much faster)
- `cargo build` compiles the developer binaries (no optimisations)
- `cargo build --release` compiles the release binaries (with optimisations)
- `cargo run` runs the project

In addition (not in the book):

- `cargo fmt` formats the project code
